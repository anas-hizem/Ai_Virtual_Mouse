# Virtual Mouse Control with Hand Tracking

## Overview
This project implements a virtual mouse control system that allows users to control the mouse cursor on their computer screen using hand gestures. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and Autopy for mouse control. The project enables intuitive interaction with computer interfaces, making it useful in various scenarios, such as presentations, touchless interfaces, and accessibility applications.

## Features
- Hand tracking using Mediapipe.
- Mouse movement control with index finger gestures.
- Click functionality using finger distance detection.
- Real-time performance metrics (FPS display).
- Smooth cursor movement for better user experience.
