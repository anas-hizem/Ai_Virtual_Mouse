# Virtual Mouse Control Using Hand Tracking

This project implements a virtual mouse control system using hand tracking. The user can control the mouse cursor on a computer screen by moving their hand in front of a camera. It leverages OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and Autopy for mouse control.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main Python files:
- **`AiVirtualMouse.py`**: The main script that runs the virtual mouse application.
- **`HandTrackingModule.py`**: Contains the `handDetector` class that handles hand tracking and gesture detection.
- **`AiVirtualMouseProject.py`**: A duplicate of the main script, possibly intended for further development or testing.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video and processing images.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Mediapipe**: For hand tracking and landmark detection.
- **Autopy**: For controlling the mouse cursor programmatically.

To install the dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe autopy
